## Q1 Project

### Project title
  - Meal Planner

### Motivation (why you made it)
  - Thinking about the most reoccuring problems in my life, one issue came up significantly more than anything else. I have a 
  of trouble planning ahead for my meals. With life being as crazy as it is, i only thought about what i was going to eat once
  i was hungry. By that time, the last thing i want to do is plan a meal, and go shopping for groceries. I found myself eating
  out for mostly all of my meals, simply for convience and ease. Noticing this pattern, and recognizing my desired to 
  eat homecooked, healthier meals, I found myself wishing a fairy would deliver my groceries, with daily meal recipes for the 
  week, while i was at work. That's when i decided to make this tool for myself.

### Features of the web app
 - Essentially, this is a meal planner. The user
  is able to search thousands of recipes, based of a few parameters, using a "food tribophysical linear extrapolating
  apparatus", as i so lovely named my recipe search engine. The search will then return a list of ten items. Clicking on the 
  base link to a recipe will reveal the ingredients and recipe associated with the dish. If the user is happy with the
  selection, then they can assign it a meal time, i.e. breakfast, lunch, or dinner, then submit it to their meal queue. The 
  queue is filled up by instance, first come first served style. Once all the meals for the week have been assigned, any 
  further meal submissions will be backlogged for the following weeks. Clicking the "weekly meal" tab, the user is brought to
  their weekly meal schedule. From here, they can click on a meal to read more about it. Also on this page, they can get a 
  compiled list of the needed ingredients for the meal, also known as a grocery list. With this list, groceries can be 
  delivered or store bought. The planning ahead and slow grocery store trolling is now a thing of the past, streamling the 
  whole process while eliminating the less desirable elements needed for cooking at home.
